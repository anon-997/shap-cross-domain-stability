## Overview

This repository contains a single script to reproduce the experiments for evaluating the cross-domain stability of SHAP explanations for sentiment classification.

**File:** `shap_consistency_sentiment_analysis.py`  
Running the script computes predictive metrics, explanation stability statistics, and generates plots, saving outputs to `results/` and `figures/`.
